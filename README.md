**Abandoned Cart Plugin for WordPress**

**Description**
The Abandoned Cart is a WordPress plugin designed for WooCommerce store owners to recover potential sales. When a customer enters their phone number at checkout but does not complete the purchase, this plugin captures the cart details and sends an email to the admin or sales team. This allows the team to follow up with the customer, offer assistance, or encourage them to complete their purchase.

**Features**
Admin Alerts: Sends detailed cart information to the admin when a customer abandons their shopping cart.
Capture Customer Details: Collects information such as the customer's first name, last name, email, address, and phone number.
Easy Email Management: Allows admin to easily configure the recipient and sender email addresses for abandonment notifications.
